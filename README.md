# ESP AHTxx v0.1.0 beta #

ESP32 esp-idf Library for Asair ATH series Temperature and Humidity sensors

## Description

This library supports AHT10, AHT20 and AHT21 sensors.
It is still work in progress, however it is already takes the correct values out of the AHT21.

## References and Credit

This library is based on Asair's demo program and Espressif's AHT20 library, which unfortunately does not support AHT21.
